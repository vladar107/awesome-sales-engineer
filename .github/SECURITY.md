# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The "Awesome Sales Engineering" repository is a curated list of resources and does not contain executable code. However, we still take security seriously.

### When to Report a Security Issue

Please report a security issue if you find:

- Links to malicious websites or resources
- Content that could be harmful to users
- Any other security concerns related to the repository

### How to Report a Security Issue

If you believe you've found a security issue in this repository, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** disclose the issue publicly in an issue or discussion
2. Email the repository maintainer directly with details about the issue
3. Allow time for the maintainer to address the issue before any public disclosure

## Security Updates

As this is a curated list and not a software project, traditional security vulnerabilities are unlikely. However, we are committed to:

- Promptly removing any links to resources that become compromised
- Addressing any GitHub-related security issues that might affect the repository
- Keeping our GitHub Actions workflows and other GitHub features up to date

## Supported Versions

This repository is maintained as a single, continuously updated list. There are no separate versions to support.
