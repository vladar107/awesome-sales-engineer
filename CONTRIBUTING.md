## How to Contribute

4. **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message

## Guidelines for Adding Resources

### Resource Quality Criteria

All resources should be:

- **Relevant** to Sales Engineering or closely related fields
- **Valuable** - providing actionable insights, practical knowledge, or useful tools
- **Current** - not outdated or deprecated (unless historically significant)
- **Accessible** - preferably free or with a reasonable cost
- **Reputable** - from trusted sources or authors

### Resource Categories

Add your resource to the appropriate category in the README.md file. If your resource doesn't fit into any existing category, you may propose a new one.

### Resource Format

Follow the existing format for consistency:

- For **Books**:
  ```
  - *Title* by Author Name
  ```

- For **Articles/Blogs**:
  ```
  - [Title](URL)
  ```

- For **Tools**:
  ```
  - [Tool Name](URL)
  ```

- For **Courses/Workshops**:
  ```
  - [Course Title](URL)
  ```

### Alphabetical Order

Within each category, try to maintain alphabetical order for easier browsing.

## Style Guide

- Use consistent Markdown formatting
- Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here" or "this link")
- Ensure all links are working and point to the intended destination
- Use proper capitalization in titles
- Keep descriptions concise and informative

## Pull Request Process

**IMPORTANT: Each pull request must contain only one resource addition.** This helps with review efficiency and maintains a clean commit history.

When submitting a pull request:

1. **Reference any related issues** in your PR description
2. **Provide context** for why the resource is valuable to Sales Engineers
3. **Follow the PR template** provided
4. **Be responsive** to feedback and be willing to make changes if requested

## Pull Request Template

When you create a pull request, a template will automatically be populated in the PR description. Please fill it out completely to help maintainers understand and review your contribution efficiently.

Remember that each PR should contain only one resource addition.

The template includes:
- Description of the resource you're adding
- Why you believe it's valuable for Sales Engineers
- Confirmation that you've followed the contribution guidelines
- Any additional context that might be helpful
